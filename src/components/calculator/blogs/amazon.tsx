        <BlogSubheading>Amazon Fees Applicable on your products</BlogSubheading>
        <BloagDescription>
          <ol className="list-decimal py-2 px-6">
            <li className="text-technovitablue">Referral Fee: </li>
            Amazon charges a referral fee for each item sold on its platform.
            The referral fee is a percentage of the item&apos;s sale price, and
            it varies by category. These fees help cover the cost of using
            Amazon&apos;s marketplace and services.
            <li className="text-technovitablue">Closing Fee:</li>
            Some categories may have an additional closing fee. This fee is
            per-item and applies to media categories like books, music, and
            video games.
            <li className="text-technovitablue">Fulfillment Fees:</li>
            If you use Amazon&apos;s fulfillment services (Fulfillment by Amazon
            or FBA), you will be charged fees for storage, picking, packing, and
            shipping your products. These fees depend on the size and weight of
            your items.
            <li className="text-technovitablue">Subscription Fees: </li>If
            you&apos;re a professional seller on Amazon, you&apos;ll pay a
            monthly subscription fee. Individual sellers do not have to pay a
            subscription fee, but they are charged a per-item fee for each sale.
            <li className="text-technovitablue">High-Volume Listing Fees:</li>
            For sellers with a large number of listings, there may be additional
            fees based on the volume of listings.
            <li className="text-technovitablue">Refund Administration Fee:</li>
            If you refund a customer for an order, Amazon may charge a refund
            administration fee, which is typically a portion of the referral
            fee.
            <li className="text-technovitablue">Other Fees: </li>There are
            various other fees related to specific services or circumstances,
            such as the removal of inventory, long-term storage fees, and more.

        <BlogSubheading>How Our Amazon Calculator Works</BlogSubheading>
        <BloagDescription>
          Our Amazon calculator is designed to help you estimate your potential
          profit when selling products on Amazon. By breaking down the process
          into clear steps, you can quickly assess your earnings. Here&apos;s a
          step-by-step guide on how our Amazon calculator works:
          <br />
          <span className="font-bold mr-4">
            Step 1: Calculate Your Referral Fees
          </span>
          <br />
          The first step is to determine your referral fees. These fees are
          based on a percentage of the item&apos;s sale price and vary by
          product category. They contribute to the cost of using Amazon&apos;s
          marketplace and services.
          <br />
          <span className="font-bold mr-4">Step 2: Find Your Closing Fees</span>
          <br />
          Some product categories may have additional closing fees. You&apos;ll
          need to identify whether your items fall into such categories and
          account for the associated closing fees, which are typically charged
          per item.
          <br />
          <span className="font-bold mr-4">
            Step 3: Calculate the Shipping Fees
          </span>
          <br />
          In this step, you&apos;ll calculate the shipping fees. If you&apos;re
          using Amazon&apos;s fulfillment services (Fulfillment by Amazon or
          FBA), you&apos;ll want to include the costs of storage, picking,
          packing, and shipping. If you&apos;re self-shipping, you should
          consider the actual cost of shipping your products to customers.
          <br />
          <span className="font-bold mr-4">Step 4: Calculate Total Fees</span>
          <br />
          The total fees are the sum of your referral fees, closing fees, and
          shipping fees (or shipping costs if you self-ship). This figure
          represents the expenses associated with selling your products on
          Amazon.
          <br />
          <span className="font-bold mr-4">Step 5: Calculate Profit</span>
          <br />
          Finally, you&apos;ll determine your profit by subtracting the total
          fees from the item&apos;s sale price. Your profit is essentially what
          remains after covering the cost of product, referral fees, closing
          fees, and any shipping expenses.
