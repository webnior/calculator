          <li className="text-technovitablue">Marketplace Fee: </li>
          Ajio charges a Marketplace fee for each item sold on its platform. The

      <BlogSubheading>How Our Ajio Calculator Works</BlogSubheading>
      <BloagDescription>
        Our Ajio calculator is designed to help you estimate your potential
        profit when selling products on Ajio. By breaking down the process into
        clear steps, you can quickly assess your earnings. Here&apos;s a
        step-by-step guide on how our Ajio calculator works:
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold mr-4">
          Step 1: Calculate Your Marketplace Fees
        </span>
        <br />
        The first step is to determine your Marketplace fees. These fees are
        based on a percentage of the item&apos;s sale price and vary by product
        category. They contribute to the cost of using Ajio&apos;s marketplace
        and services.
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold mr-4">Step 2: Calculate Overall GST</span>
        <br />
        Overall GST (Goods and Services Tax): This is the government-imposed tax
        on the value of the product.
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold mr-4">
          Step 3: Calculate the Shipping Fees
        </span>
        <br />
        This is the cost associated with shipping the product to the customer.
        The exact amount can vary based on factors such as the shipping method
        and location.
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold mr-4">Step 4: Calculate Total Fees</span>
        <br />
        The total fees are the sum of your Marketplace fees, Overall GST, and
        shipping fees (or shipping costs if you self-ship). This figure
        represents the expenses associated with selling your products on ajio.
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold mr-4">Step 5: Calculate Profit</span>
        <br />
        Finally, you&apos;ll determine your profit by subtracting the total fees
        from the item&apos;s sale price. Your profit is essentially what remains
        after covering the cost of product, marketplace fees, Overall GST, and
        any shipping expenses.
