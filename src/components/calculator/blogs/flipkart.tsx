      <BloagDescription>
        <ol className="list-decimal py-2 px-6">
          <li className="text-technovitablue">Commission Fee: </li>
          Flipkart charges a Commission fee for each item sold on its platform.
          The Commission fee is a percentage of the item&apos;s sale price, and
          it varies by category. These fees help cover the cost of using
          Flipkart&apos;s marketplace and services.
          <li className="text-technovitablue">Collection Fee:</li>
          Some categories may have an additional collection fee. This fee is
          per-item and applies to media categories like books, music, and video
          games.
          <li className="text-technovitablue">Fulfillment Fees:</li>
          If you use Flipkart&apos;s fulfillment services (Fulfillment by
          Flipkart or FBF), you will be charged fees for storage, picking,
          packing, and shipping your products. These fees depend on the size and
          weight of your items.
          <li className="text-technovitablue">Subscription Fees: </li>If
          you&apos;re a professional seller on Flipkart, you&apos;ll pay a
          monthly subscription fee. Individual sellers do not have to pay a
          subscription fee, but they are charged a per-item fee for each sale.
          <li className="text-technovitablue">High-Volume Listing Fees:</li>For
          sellers with a large number of listings, there may be additional fees
          based on the volume of listings.
          <li className="text-technovitablue">Refund Administration Fee:</li>If
          you refund a customer for an order, Flipkart may charge a refund
          administration fee, which is typically a portion of the commission
          fee.
          <li className="text-technovitablue">Other Fees: </li>There are various
          other fees related to specific services or circumstances, such as the

      <BlogSubheading>How Our Flipkart Calculator Works</BlogSubheading>
      <BloagDescription>
        Our Flipkart calculator is designed to help you estimate your potential
        profit when selling products on Flipkart. By breaking down the process
        into clear steps, you can quickly assess your earnings. Here&apos;s a
        step-by-step guide on how our Flipkart calculator works:
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold mr-4">
          Step 1: Calculate Your Commission Fees
        </span>
        <br />
        The first step is to determine your Commission fees. These fees are
        based on a percentage of the item&apos;s sale price and vary by product
        category. They contribute to the cost of using Flipkart&apos;s
        marketplace and services.
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold mr-4">
          Step 2: Find Your Collection Fees
        </span>
        <br />
        Some product categories may have additional collection fees. You&apos;ll
        need to identify whether your items fall into such categories and
        account for the associated collection fees, which are typically charged
        per item.
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold mr-4">
          Step 3: Calculate the Shipping Fees
        </span>
        <br />
        In this step, you&apos;ll calculate the shipping fees. If you&apos;re
        using Flipkart&apos;s fulfillment services (Fulfillment by Flipkart or
        FBF), you&apos;ll want to include the costs of storage, picking,
        packing, and shipping. If you&apos;re self-shipping, you should consider
        the actual cost of shipping your products to customers.
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold mr-4">Step 4: Calculate Total Fees</span>
        <br />
        The total fees are the sum of your Commission fees, collection fees, and
        shipping fees (or shipping costs if you self-ship). This figure
        represents the expenses associated with selling your products on
        Flipkart.
        <br />
        <span className="font-bold mr-4">Step 5: Calculate Profit</span>
        <br />
        Finally, you&apos;ll determine your profit by subtracting the total fees
        from the item&apos;s sale price. Your profit is essentially what remains
        after covering the cost of product, commission fees, collection fees,
        and any shipping expenses.
