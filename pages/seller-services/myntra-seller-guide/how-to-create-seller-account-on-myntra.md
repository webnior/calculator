## Documents Required for Amazon Seller Account Creation

To successfully create an Amazon Seller Account, you'll need to gather a few essential documents and pieces of information. Ensure you have the following ready:

1. **Bank Account:**

   - A valid bank account is crucial for financial transactions and receiving payments from your Amazon sales.

2. **GST Number:**

   - For most product categories, having a Goods and Services Tax (GST) number is a requirement. However, some categories, such as books, may be exempted from this requirement.

3. **Shipping Address:**

   - Provide a clear and accurate shipping address where Amazon can send your products or correspondence.

4. **Email and Contact Information:**
   - A valid email address and contact information are necessary for account communication and verification processes.

Ensuring you have these documents and information ready in advance will streamline the Amazon Seller Account creation process, allowing you to establish your presence on the platform efficiently.

## Step 1: Initiating Registration on Amazon Seller Central

To commence the registration process, visit [Amazon.in](https://www.amazon.in) or [sell.amazon.in](https://sell.amazon.in) and click on 'Start Selling' to create your seller account.

If you already have a customer account on Amazon.in or Prime Video, you can seamlessly use the same email and password for creating your seller account. Upon signing in with these credentials, you'll be prompted to verify your phone number through an OTP.

If you do not possess a customer account or wish to create a new seller account, select 'Create your Amazon account.' On the subsequent screen, provide your name, mobile number, email address, and set up a password. Click on ‘Continue’ to proceed with the registration process.

## Step 2: Enter GST Number

After successfully signing in, the next crucial step is to provide your Goods and Services Tax (GST) number. The GST number is essential for tax compliance and varies depending on the type of products you intend to sell.

If your products fall under the GST tax bracket, simply enter your GST number when prompted. This information is vital for transparent and legal transactions within the e-commerce ecosystem.

For those intending to sell GST-exempt products, such as books, Amazon provides a convenient option. Select the choice – ‘I only sell tax-exempted products such as books’ during the registration process. This ensures that your account aligns with the specific taxation requirements for tax-exempt items, streamlining your selling experience on the platform.

# Step 3: Verify GST Number

Once you've entered your Goods and Services Tax (GST) number, the next step is to click on 'Continue to Verify.’ This action will prompt the generation of a GST One-Time Password (OTP), which will be sent to both the email and mobile number of the primary GST holder.

If, for any reason, you do not receive the OTP, it's recommended to check with your Chartered Accountant (CA) or any individual who may have provided their phone number during the GST registration process.

In the event of three unsuccessful attempts to verify the GST number via OTP within a 24-hour period, you have two options. After 24 hours, you can request a new OTP for verification. Alternatively, you also have the option to expedite the process by uploading your GST certificate for verification.

# Step 4: Enter Store Name

Elevate the identity of your Amazon.in store by choosing a distinctive store name. This name serves as the primary representation of your business to customers on Amazon.in, making it a crucial aspect of your brand presence.

You have the option to either accept the auto-generated store name suggestions provided by Amazon, tailored to enhance visibility and appeal, or you can infuse your personal touch by manually entering a unique store name of your choice.

Selecting an engaging and memorable store name is an essential step in creating a strong brand image that resonates with your target audience. Take the time to consider the tone and message you want your store name to convey, ensuring it aligns with your business values and offerings.

# Step 5: Enter Pickup Address

Now, it's time to provide the pickup address details. This address is crucial as Amazon will collect product shipments for customer orders directly from this location.

By default, the address associated with your Goods and Services Tax (GST) registration will be available as an option. If you wish to use a different location for product pickups, you can add a new address by clicking on ‘Add new address’ under account settings on Seller Central.

It's important to note that the pickup address must be located in the same state as the one in which your GST is registered. This alignment ensures compliance with regional regulations and facilitates a smooth shipping and delivery process for your customers.

# Step 6: Choose Shipping Method

Moving forward, you'll need to select a shipping method that aligns with your business model and logistics preferences. Amazon provides two primary shipping options for delivering products to your customers:

1. **Easy Ship:**

   - With Easy Ship, you store and pack your orders at your designated pickup location, and Amazon takes care of the subsequent steps, including picking up and delivering the products to your customers.
   - It's a convenient option, especially for those looking for a streamlined fulfillment process. However, it's important to note that additional fees, such as weight handling fees and pick and pack fees, may apply.

2. **Self Ship:**
   - Opting for Self Ship gives you greater control over the entire shipping process. You are responsible for storing, packing, and shipping your products either independently or by utilizing third-party services to handle the delivery to customers.
   - This method provides flexibility but requires more hands-on involvement. It's suitable for sellers who prefer managing their own logistics and want to explore external shipping services.

Choose the shipping method that best fits your business strategy and logistics capabilities, ensuring a seamless and efficient order fulfillment process.

# Step 7: Add Bank Account

In the next step, it's time to link your active bank account to your Amazon Seller Account. This is a crucial step as the money generated from your online sales on Amazon.in will be transferred directly to this bank account.

To complete this process, provide the necessary details of the bank account that you use for your business. Ensure the accuracy of the information to facilitate seamless financial transactions and the timely transfer of funds from your Amazon sales.

Adding your bank account details not only ensures the smooth flow of your earnings but also enables you to efficiently manage your finances associated with your Amazon seller activities.

# Step 8: Select Default Tax Rate

In this step, you are required to choose the Default GST rate or Product Tax Code (PTC). This rate is predetermined for each category, as specified by the government. It represents the percentage of taxes applicable to the sale of products or services within that category.

The selected Default GST rate/PTC will be utilized to calculate taxes on your product listings in cases where you haven't explicitly chosen any specific tax code. This ensures consistency in tax calculations across your product offerings, streamlining the tax-related aspects of your Amazon seller account.
