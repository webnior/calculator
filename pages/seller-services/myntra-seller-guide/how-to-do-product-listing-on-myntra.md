## Two Ways to List Products on Amazon

### 1. For Products Available on Amazon(step by step guide) -

With over 200 million products listed on the Amazon.in marketplace, leveraging existing listings is a convenient way to start selling. Search for the ASIN (Amazon Standard Identification Number) of the product you want to sell on Amazon.in. If you find a match, simply add your price and quantity to the existing ASIN to list and commence selling. You can use UPC/EAN, product name, model number, brand name, etc., to find the right match. This method is suitable for products that are exact matches to those already available on Amazon.in.

If you wish to sell a product that is already available on Amazon, follow these steps:

#### Step 1: Get the ASIN of the product you want to sell

#### Step 4: Craft Your Offer

In this pivotal step, customize your product offer by providing essential details:

1. **Enter Your Selling Price (Standard Price):**

   - Specify the price at which you want to sell your product. This is the standard price that customers will see.

2. **Choose Item Condition (Offering Condition Type):**

   - Indicate the condition of your item, such as new, used, or refurbished.

3. **Select Fulfillment Channel:**

   - Choose between two options for your Fulfillment Channel:
     - **Merchant Fulfilled (FBM):**
       - If you opt for Merchant Fulfilled, you will need to add the quantity of the product available.
     - **Fulfillment by Amazon (FBA):**
       - If you choose Fulfillment by Amazon, the system will guide you through the process of creating an FBA shipment.

4. **Contribution SKU (Optional):**
   - Assign a unique product identifier, known as a Contribution SKU, for your internal tracking purposes. For instance, you can use something like "DG_Pouch_01." This section is optional, and if you don't choose your own SKU, Amazon will assign one for you.

Once you've inputted all the necessary information, click on “Save and Finish” at the bottom to solidify your offer.

### 2. For New Products not yet listed on Amazon

If your product is not currently available on Amazon.in, follow these steps to create a new listing, providing customers with all the essential information:

1. **Title:**

   - Maximum of 200 characters. Capitalize the first letter of every word for a polished presentation.

2. **Images:**

   - Dimensions of 500 x 500 pixels or 1,000 x 1,000 pixels to meet Amazon Image Guidelines and enhance listing quality.

3. **Variations:**

   - Include different variations such as colors, scents, or sizes if applicable.

4. **Bullet Points:**

   - Craft short, descriptive sentences highlighting key features and benefits of your product.

5. **Featured Offer ("Offer Display"):**

   - Designate the featured offer on the product detail page. Customers can either click on “Add to Cart” or “Offer Display.”

6. **Other Offers:**

   - Display the same product sold by multiple sellers, each offering different prices, shipping options, etc.

7. **Description:**
   - Optimize the description using relevant keywords to improve the discoverability of your listing.

When you adhere to these guidelines and provide accurate and compelling information, your new listing will be well-positioned to attract and engage potential customers on the Amazon marketplace.
